# repo-one
My first repo!

I am going to catalog Ruby and Arduino Progress in this repo.

Just a way to keep track :)

Edit: Taking a break from Arduino. Ruby is my main focus rn

    Working on a simple rails app
    Will be focusing more on OOP for ruby as well

# Got a simple Rails App running!

Go to: http://rails.selfup.me

    If it takes a second to load, it has not been fired up!
    Once fired up, the redirect to Heroku and the Rails app will speed up
    Enjoy it :)

It is hosted on a private repo
Running on Heroku
Developed on c9.io
:)

Work in progress
