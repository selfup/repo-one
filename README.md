# repo-one
My first repo!

This is going to be a way to show the world that I am dedicated to learning Ruby.

I will put up little programs here and there to see if people like my code.

--IntChomp.rb is an Interactive gets.chomp program.

--FizzbuzzLOL.rb is an interactive Fizzbuzz program with an additional variant of Fizzbuzz included called "LOL".

--99BoB.rb is a basic "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" song that runs in your temrinal via text.
