# repo-one
My first repo!

I am going to catalog Ruby/JS/MEAN/HTML/CSS/Arduino Progress in this repo.

**Update: 5/4/2015**

    I will be doing stuff in Javascript now :)
    The folder "javascriptNotes" will be a journal of sorts
    I will be taking notes of a recource I am learning from
    All 'notes' will be taken via vim and pushed in iTerm2

Just a way to keep track :)

Edit: Taking a break from Arduino. Ruby is my main focus rn

**Update: This was a while ago!**

    Working on a simple rails app
    Will be focusing more on OOP for ruby as well

# Got a simple Rails App running!

Go to: http://rails.selfup.me

    If it takes a second to load, it has not been fired up!
    Once fired up, the redirect to Heroku and the Rails app will speed up
    Enjoy it :)

* It is hosted on a private repo

* Running on Heroku

* Developed on c9.io

* Pictures now on AWS S3!!!

* Work in progress!
