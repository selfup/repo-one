# repo-one
My first repo!

This is going to be a way to show the world that I am dedicated to learning Ruby.

I will put up little programs here and there to see if people like my code.

Intchomp.rb is an Interactive gets.chomp program.
FizzbuzzLOL.rb is an interactive Fizzbuzz program with an aditional variant of Fizzbuzz included called "LOL".

My next repo will be more mature. I might even put up some Lua code for Minecraft people!
