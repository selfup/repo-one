    Working on a simple rails app
    Will be focusing more on OOP for ruby as well

# Got a simple Rails App running!

Go to: http://rails.selfup.me

    If it takes a second to load, it has not been fired up!
    Once fired up, the redirect to Heroku and the Rails app will speed up
    Enjoy it :)
