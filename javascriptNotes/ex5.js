//Math Expressions//

var popNum = 4;

//or//

var popNum = 2 + 2;

//also..//

alert(2 + 2);

//My Fav..the Modulus or Modulo as some call it.//

var whatIsLeftOver = 104 % 9;

//This will return what is left over, or the 'remainder'.//

//Great for ruling out odd numbers//

//Ex://

var oddLy = 3;

if (oddLy % 2 === 1)
	console.log('Odd!');

/*By using 'modulo 2 equals 1' we know that
the number is odd because there is something left over
after deviding it by 2!*/

//Also remember that curly brackets are not needed for IF statements in JS. This will be a hard habit for me to break coming from ruby...//

if (oddLy % 2 === 1){
	console.log('Odd!');
}

/*Here the IF statement is the same. 
It just has curly brackets vs not having them.
The strangest part is there not being an 'end' statement. 
Maybe that's why people use curly brackets!*/
