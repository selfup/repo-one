var name = 'Mark';

//Now if I change my name to Ace//

//And declare after the Mark var line//

//Javascript will just print out Ace//

//Example Ahead!//

var name = 'Ace';

//I have now changed the variable (within the Global Scope)//

//Javascript will forever think var "name" = 'Ace' until told otherwise//

/*Once a varirable has been declared, you don't have to declare it again.
You just assign a new vlaue to it.*/

//Remember to give your variables meaningful names//

//This way you can understand your code in the future//
