//Variables!//

var weight = 167;

//That variable can be used in math functions since it is indeed a number//

//I can do something like..//

weight + 10;

//My result would be 177//

//If I did..//

weight + "90"; /*or*/ weight + '32';

//I would get//

16790 /*or*/ 16732

/*When specifying a number for an Alert message, JS will turn
it into a string so that it outputs correctly*/

/*Also: using 1 as the first character for a variable is ILLEGAL.
Use $ or _ but not a **number**. So for example..*/

var  $_1 = 101;

//Would be correct!//

/*The only special characters that can be used for variables are ("$" and "_") so use them sparingly!*/

//END//
