var spec = prompt('Your species?', 'human');

//DO NOT RUN THIS IN NODE!//
//Won't work//

//Cmd + Option + I ..or.. f12 for non OSX//
//Then copy pastaaaa into console//

//Now to use a neat example//

var hello = 'Hey are you enjoying this so far?';
var defAns = 'Yea for sure!';
var spec2 = prompt(hello, defAns);

//Time to try this out!//

//END//

/*

Just simply declaring a variable as a prompt
will initiate a prompt.

You do not need to call it at a later date.

Very interesting behavior.
