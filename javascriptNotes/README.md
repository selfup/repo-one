#Purpose

This is just a learning/coding journal.

I am using a resource to learn JS. I will catalog it as a project.

This will keep me motivated!

#My .vimrc

**Nothing speacial but this is what I use:**

	set ruler laststatus=2 number title hlsearch mouse=a
 	2 syntax on

**Try it out if you want**

**Turns out JS style is similar to ruby with 2 spaces for tab**

**I was unaware! Style will be implemented from now on**

**Also comments are to have spaces after the slashes...**

	Example:
	// This is a proper comment //
	//This is bad m'kay//

Nothing more to report for this README.
